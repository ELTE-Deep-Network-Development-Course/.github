Each repository will have a main branch and semester branches. The main branch will always reflect the current semester's branch, making it easy to update codes from previous years. In later semesters, we can create pull requests to the main branch, which lets everyone see the changes made to last year's material and suggest modifications. This way, we avoid lengthy shared-screen sessions, saving time and keeping collaboration efficient.
